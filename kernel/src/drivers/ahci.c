    An AHCI controller can be found by enumerating the PCI bus. It has a class id 0x01 (mass storage device) and normally a subclass id 0x06 (serial ATA). The vendor id and device id should also be checked to ensure itâ€™s really an AHCI controller.
    Determining what mode the controller is in

    As you may be aware, a SATA controller can either be in IDE emulation mode or in AHCI mode. The problem that enters here is simple:
    How to find what mode the controller is in. The documentation is really obscure on this. Perhaps the best way is to initialize a SATA controller as both IDE and AHCI. In this way, as long as you are careful about non-existent ports, you cannot go wrong.

    One possible way of doing this is by checking the bit 31 of GHC register. It's labeled as AHCI Enable.
